My more ambitious and time-consuming projects

Bakery

This is simple GUI application which enables bakers to ensure that their baked goods are equally fantastic every time by calculating the amount of ingredients needed via a built-in calculator that works on recipes saved by the owner. He can remove, add and edit products using his "ADMIN" panel, to which he must enter a password.
I'm using here Tkinter and werkzeug.security.
Password is in txt file after being hashed and salted, user data is in JSON.
